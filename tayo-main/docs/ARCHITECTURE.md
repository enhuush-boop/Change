# Architecture, security, and design notes

TAYO is a thin browser UI over a local analysis service. This document
explains the split, the request flows, the trust model, and what would need to
change for production.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

- **Local-first:** no account, no cloud inference, no telemetry; media stays on
  the machine.
- **Journalist-friendly:** every conclusion carries evidence links, uncertainty,
  and a recommended next step.
- **Honest:** classifiers are described as signals, not proof. Missing evidence
  produces “Not Sure”.
- **Safe URL triage:** inspect a suspicious link without opening it in the
  user's browser. TAYO fetches only static HTML and never executes page scripts.
- **Runnable demo:** CPU-only path, clear setup, no build step for the extension.

### Non-goals

- Forensic verification or a definitive “fake” verdict.
- Unrestricted web search or a general claim-verification oracle.
- Detecting every generator, deepfake, or manipulation.
- Multi-user hosting, authentication, or a hardened public API.
- Chrome Web Store publication (the project documents the path, but the demo is
  loaded unpacked).

### Why the extension is thin

MV3 service workers are event-driven and short-lived; they are not a reliable
home for a multi-hundred-megabyte PyTorch model or a long ffmpeg job. The side
panel is a normal extension page, but it is still a browser context with CSP,
memory, and store-policy constraints. Keeping models in a local process gives:

- warm model weights and predictable latency,
- access to ffmpeg and raw sockets,
- simple Python evaluation tooling,
- a single place for SSRF controls and API keys.

A pure-extension design would require tiny quantized ONNX models in
WASM/WebGPU and a hosted API for everything else. That is a valid future
direction, not this demo.

## 3. Request flows

### 3.1 Fact-check

```text
panel.js ──POST /api/factcheck {claim}──▶ factcheck_claim()
                                           │
                                           ├─ normalize + fuzzy match curated corpus
                                           │    └─ confidence = corpus confidence × match score
                                           ├─ optional Google Fact Check Tools API
                                           ├─ optional Ollama summary (evidence only)
                                           └─ fallback: "Not Sure" + search links
        ◀── {verdict, summary, evidence[], limitations[]} ──
```

- The corpus (`backend/app/data/factchecks.json`) contains aliases, keywords,
  verdict, explanation, and evidence with source/URL/snippet/relation.
- Matching combines RapidFuzz token-set similarity (45%), Jaccard token overlap
  (35%), and keyword coverage (20%). The threshold is 0.58 for English and
  0.75 for detected Mongolian. Cyrillic and informal galig are folded to a
  comparable Latin key; negated variants cannot inherit a corpus verdict.
- Google ratings are normalized: “false/misleading/hoax/…” → `False`;
  “true/correct/…” → `True`; “half/partly/mixed” or unknown → `Not Sure`.
- Ollama receives only the claim, verdict, and retrieved evidence. The prompt
  forbids adding facts. If it fails, the template summary remains.
- “Not Sure” always includes search links so a journalist can continue
  manually.

### 3.2 Text

```text
panel.js ──POST /api/analyze/text {text}──▶ threadpool ──▶ ModernBERT
                                                        + 250-word chunks
                                                        + quality gate
                                                        + stylometry + checks
        ◀── {label, ai_probability, checks, coverage, quality, stats, …} ──
```

- Text is split into 250-word windows; at most eight chunks are scored. The
  reported model score is the mean over chunks, and partial coverage is
  flagged instead of being hidden.
- Temperature scaling from `detector-config.json` (1.566…) is applied.
- A quality gate skips the model for inputs with fewer than 3 words, fewer
  than 20 characters, or obvious repetition. A label is withheld for texts
  under 50 words, partial coverage, model errors, or unvalidated languages.
- If the model is disabled or unavailable, a transparent heuristic runs and is
  labeled as weak; it never becomes an authorship verdict.
- Stylometry (sentence-length variation, type–token ratio, trigram repetition,
  phrase hits) is displayed for explanation, not combined into a fake
  “certainty”.
- The response also carries 18 descriptive checks across 14 groups: length,
  script, vocabulary, 50-word window diversity, repeated words, trigram
  repetition, duplicate sentences, sentence-length variation/range,
  paragraph/list structure, phrases, invisible characters, references, and
  model coverage. Plagiarism, Mongolian spelling/grammar, fact accuracy, and
  perplexity are marked unavailable rather than estimated.
- For Mongolian Cyrillic or recognized informal Latin galig, Unicode-aware
  statistics are returned alongside an explicitly experimental model score.
  The result stays `Uncertain` because the English-trained model has not been
  validated for Mongolian. Users can select `mn_latn` manually when informal
  spelling defeats automatic detection.

### 3.3 Image

```text
panel.js ──multipart file──▶ temp file ──▶ EXIF/XMP/C2PA hints
                                       └──▶ Smaug classifier
        ◀── {label, ai_probability, metadata, signals, sha256, limitations} ──

panel.js ──POST image URL──▶ SSRF checks ──▶ backend fetch (size/type caps)
                                          └──▶ same analysis

right-click blob/protected image ──▶ visible-image screenshot crop
                                  └─▶ image analysis (metadata unavailable)
```

- Images are converted to RGB and passed to the configured model(s). The
  default is Smaug alone; if it cannot load, the registry automatically loads
  the smaller Ateeqq SigLIP model. Enabling the optional third model averages
  probabilities without calibration or weighting.
- Label bands: ≥0.80 “Likely AI”, ≥0.60 “Possibly AI”, ≤0.20 “Likely real”,
  ≤0.40 “Possibly real”, otherwise “Uncertain”. These are UI heuristics, not
  scientifically calibrated thresholds.
- Metadata checks are independent signals: generator names, camera make/model,
  EXIF presence, C2PA/JUMBF marker presence.
- **C2PA is presence-only.** The demo does not verify signatures or trust lists.
  A malicious file can contain the string “c2pa”. For real provenance, use the
  `c2pa-python` SDK, validate the manifest, and check the signer certificate.
- SHA-256 is computed for record-keeping and duplicate detection.
- Screenshot fallback checks the displayed pixels only. It cannot recover the
  original image's resolution, EXIF, or C2PA manifest.

### 3.4 Video

```text
panel.js ──multipart file──▶ per-request temp dir
                              ├─ ffmpeg/ffprobe metadata
                              ├─ 8 evenly spaced frames
                              └─ image model per frame
        ◀── {mean/max probability, per-frame scores, metadata, limitations} ──

right-click public video URL ──▶ resolve + pin public IP per redirect
                              └─▶ size-limited temporary file ──▶ same analysis

right-click blob/stream video ──▶ activeTab visible-frame capture
                               └─▶ image analysis (single frame only)
```

- This is frame sampling, not a video deepfake model. It can miss short
  manipulations, temporal artifacts, audio fakes, and lip-sync errors.
- Frames are deleted with the per-request temporary directory.
- Video URL downloads have the same 100 MB default cap as uploads. Browser
  cookies are not forwarded. Playlists, DRM, and authenticated sources may not
  be available to the backend.
- A captured player frame is an image result, explicitly labelled as one frame.
- A mean is reported alongside the max and the count above 80%, because one
  manipulated frame is easy to hide in an average.

### 3.5 URL scan and static link dossier

```text
panel.js ──POST /api/check/url──▶ parse + resolve host (SSRF guard)
                                  ├─ offline heuristics (scheme, userinfo, IDN,
                                  │  IP literal, port, TLD, brand lookalike, …)

                                  ├─ TLS handshake + certificate parse

                                          │
                                  static GET with pinned public IPs
                                  ├─ follow up to 5 redirects; record each hop
                                  ├─ bounded gzip/deflate decoding and size caps
                                  ├─ visible text + metadata + page type
                                  ├─ extractive overview, key points, topics

                                  ├─ frames, inline/external scripts, meta refresh
                                  ├─ mixed content, base href, security headers
                                  └─ cross-host final destination rescanned
                                     (VirusTotal lookup only, no auto-submit)
                                          │
                                  fact-check concise page claims
        ◀── {overview, safety, destination_security, factchecks,
             factcheck_overview, website, security} ──
```

- `/api/scan/url` remains the reputation-only endpoint. `/api/check/url` adds
  the static dossier used by the Link tab.
- The backend fetches **static HTML only**. It does not execute JavaScript,
  render the page, open PDFs/media, or download and run files from the page.
- The page is fetched only when reputation is not explicitly malicious. Fetches
  are SSRF-guarded, capped by response size and timeout, and limited to five
  redirects. Compressed responses are decoded with an output cap.
- The overview is deterministic and extractive from metadata and visible text;
  it is not a screenshot, an LLM summary, or a reproduction of the article.
- Cross-host redirect destinations are rescanned for reputation. They are not
  automatically submitted to VirusTotal, because that would publish a URL the
  user has not chosen to submit. The primary URL keeps the existing VirusTotal
  workflow: reuse an existing report, otherwise submit when a key is configured.
  Submitted URLs may be community-visible.
- `safety.level` is one of `do_not_open`, `sandbox_only`, `caution`, `unknown`,
  or `no_strong_signal`. It combines reputation, redirect destination, and
  static findings with plain-language next steps. It is triage, not proof.
- **Zero-click limitation:** static inspection cannot detect browser, PDF, or
  media exploit chains that require execution, nor a site that turns malicious
  only after login. The API and UI state this explicitly. Use a patched browser
  and a disposable VM or sandbox service for untrusted links.
- Risk weights are additive and capped at 100. Examples: threat-intel match +60,
  invalid TLS +30, domain <30 days +25, brand lookalike +28, raw IP +25.
- The score is an explainable triage heuristic, not a probability.
- DNS/TLS are hygiene signals. Phishing sites routinely use valid DV
  certificates and DNSSEC-enabled domains.

## 4. Backend modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Routes, CORS, upload streaming/limits, temp cleanup, request logging. |
| `config.py` | Loads `backend/.env`; model IDs, device, keys, limits, CORS. |
| `schemas.py` | Pydantic request models and length constraints. |
| `services/model_registry.py` | Lazy image/text model loading, Smaug adapter and automatic fallback, label mapping, temperature scaling, singleton caches, status. |
| `services/smaug_image_detect.py` | Vendored Apache-2.0 wrapper for Smaug so no hub-downloaded Python executes at runtime. |
| `services/factcheck.py` | Corpus matching, Google API, rating normalization, Ollama summaries, no-match search links. |
| `services/text_analysis.py` | Quality gate, 250-word chunking, ModernBERT inference, coverage, stylometry, labels, limitations. |
| `services/checks.py` | 18 descriptive checks across 14 groups; unavailable checks are explicit, not guessed. |
| `services/image_analysis.py` | Metadata + classifiers ensemble, labels/confidence, image URL fetch with SSRF checks. |
| `services/video_analysis.py` | Frame scoring, aggregation, video-specific uncertainty. |
| `services/video_url_fetch.py` | Download a direct public video, recheck redirects, pin public IPs, and enforce size/type limits. |
| `services/url_scan.py` | Offline signals, DoH, TLS certificate inspection, RDAP, threat intel, scoring. |
| `services/web_content.py` | SSRF-guarded static HTML fetch, redirects, decompression, extraction, overview, and page inspection. |
| `services/link_dossier.py` | Combines reputation and static findings into safety levels, next steps, and fact-check overviews. |
| `services/metadata.py` | Pillow EXIF/info, C2PA/software markers, ffmpeg/ffprobe metadata, frame extraction. |
| `services/net_utils.py` | URL parsing and private/loopback/reserved address blocking. |

### Concurrency and caching

- FastAPI runs inference in a threadpool so the event loop stays responsive.
- Models are process-wide singletons protected by locks. The registry loads on
  first use, not at startup, so fact-checking and URL scanning work even if
  model download fails.
- There is no request queue. Concurrent image/video analyses compete for CPU
  and memory. The demo assumes a single journalist.
- Temp uploads use `tempfile` and are deleted in `finally` blocks; video frames
  live inside a `TemporaryDirectory`.

---

## 5. Extension design

### Manifest V3

- **Permissions:** `activeTab`, `contextMenus`, `scripting`, `storage`,
  `sidePanel`.
- **Host permissions:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/*` and
  `http://localhost:8000/*`.
- **Page access:** an image, video, or page-text context-menu click grants
  temporary `activeTab` access. The service worker injects a one-time function
  into the main frame to locate visible media or read article text. Media
  screenshot fallbacks use the visible tab. Selected text and links use the
  context-menu payload. There is no persistent content script or `<all_urls>`
  permission.
- **Side panel** is declared statically and opened on toolbar click via
  `setPanelBehavior`.
- **Pending requests** use `chrome.storage.session`, so a request is not lost
  if the panel is not ready. Session storage is cleared when the browser
  closes and is not exposed to content scripts by default.

### Rendering safety

- All backend-provided text is rendered with `textContent` and DOM APIs.
- Evidence links are created as anchors only when the URL starts with
  `http://` or `https://`, with `rel="noreferrer noopener"`.
- There is no `innerHTML` with remote data, no `eval`, no remote script, and no
  third-party CDN.
- CSP is the extension default (MV3 disallows remote code). The panel does not
  need inline scripts.

### Settings

- Backend URL is stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
- The default localhost origins are authorized statically. Changing the origin
  requires a manifest edit; this is a deliberate MV3 constraint, not a bug.
- “Clear saved data” clears local and session storage and resets the URL.

## 6. Security and privacy

### Threat model (demo scope)

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Malicious page injects content into the panel | One-shot page reads after user action; textContent rendering; no HTML injection. |
| SSRF via image/video URL input | Reject non-HTTP(S), block private/loopback/link-local/reserved IPs, revalidate redirects, cap redirects, size, and content type. Video downloads pin the checked public IP. |
| DoS via huge upload | Streamed upload with `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` cap and 413 response. |
| Path traversal via filename | Server-generated temp names; only a short sanitized suffix is reused. |
| XSS via claim/evidence | Safe DOM APIs; links allow only http(s). |
| Extension fetches arbitrary origins | Static host permissions limited to localhost; backend URL must be allowed by manifest. |
| Secret leakage | Centrally managed keys remain in backend `.env`. A user-connected VirusTotal key is stored in extension-private local storage, sent only to the localhost backend, represented as a Pydantic secret, and never returned in responses. |
| Model pickle risk | Prefer safetensors checkpoints; production should pin revisions and verify hashes. |

### Network behavior

| Action | Destination | When |
|---|---|---|
| Health/config | localhost | Panel open/retry. |
| Claim check | localhost; Google Fact Check only with key | User submits claim. |
| Text/image/video | localhost only | User submits content or chooses a context-menu action. |
| Image URL | Target public host (fetched by backend) | User enters or right-clicks a public image URL. |
| Image screenshot | localhost only | User right-clicks a blob image or its direct download fails. |
| Video URL | Target public host (fetched by backend, no browser cookies) | User enters a video URL or right-clicks a video. |
| Video frame | localhost only | User right-clicks a blob/stream player or direct download fails. |
| URL scan | Google DoH (host), RDAP (domain), TLS target; threat intel only with keys | User submits URL. VirusTotal receives and scans the full URL when configured. |
| Ollama summary | localhost Ollama | Fact-check with `OLLAMA_URL` set. |

No analytics, crash reporting, accounts, or cloud model calls are built in.
Hugging Face is contacted only to download model weights.

### SSRF details and residual risk

`resolve_public_host()` rejects hostnames ending in `.local`, `.internal`,
`.localhost`, `.home.arpa`, and any resolved address that is private, loopback,
link-local, multicast, reserved, unspecified, or not global. Redirects in
`fetch_image_from_url()` and `fetch_video_url()` follow at most five redirects,
revalidating each hop. Video downloads connect to the checked public IP while
preserving Host and TLS SNI. The URL scanner itself never fetches the URL.

Residual risks:

- **Image DNS rebinding / TOCTOU:** image URL resolution is checked first,
  then httpx resolves again when connecting. Its transport still needs IP
  pinning or an egress proxy before production use.
- **Proxy environment variables:** httpx may honor proxies; a production
  deployment should disable or control them.
- **IPv4-mapped IPv6 and unusual encodings:** Python's `ipaddress` covers the
  common cases, but fuzzing is warranted.
- **Redirects to internal services** are rechecked in the image fetcher; the
  URL scanner does not follow redirects at all.
- **Model/media parser vulnerabilities:** Pillow/ffmpeg run in-process. A
  hostile file could exploit a decoder. Production should sandbox media parsing
  in a separate, resource-limited worker/container.

### CORS

The backend defaults to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` with credentials disabled, which is
appropriate only for a loopback demo. Extension pages send `Origin:
chrome-extension://<id>`. For a shared deployment, set an explicit allowlist and
add authentication.

### Data retention

- Uploads and extracted frames are deleted per request.
- The backend logs method, path, status, latency, and request ID — not claim
  text or media contents.
- Model cache and `chrome.storage` settings persist locally until deleted.
- No database. Fact-check corpus is a JSON file.

## 7. Production hardening checklist

If this moves beyond a local demo:

1. **Authentication and authorization.** API tokens or mTLS; per-user quotas;
   audit logs without sensitive content.
2. **Network isolation.** Run analysis workers in containers with restricted
   egress; use an egress proxy with DNS pinning; block link-local/metadata
   endpoints at the network layer too.
3. **Sandbox media decoders.** Separate worker with seccomp/AppArmor, memory and
   CPU limits, no network.
4. **Request queue and backpressure.** One model per worker; bounded queue;
   cancellation; per-request timeouts.
5. **Model supply chain.** Pin revisions, verify checksums, prefer safetensors,
   scan artifacts, record model versions in every result for reproducibility.
6. **Calibration and evaluation.** Build a licensed, diverse test set; report
   confidence intervals; calibrate thresholds per model; monitor drift. Never
   ship a threshold tuned on the same small set used to report accuracy.
7. **C2PA verification.** Use the official SDK and a trust list; distinguish
   “manifest present” from “signature valid and signer trusted”.
8. **Provenance and reverse image search.** Integrate approved services; keep
   human review in the loop.
9. **Evidence retrieval.** Add a trusted-source index with retrieval,
   entailment/stance classification, source-reliability metadata, and
   date-aware answers. Do not let an LLM invent evidence.
10. **Extension distribution.** Privacy policy, permission justifications,
    reproducible builds, CSP review, no remote code, store screenshots.
11. **Abuse and privacy.** Rate limits, retention policy, redaction, user
    consent for external API calls, and a clear “no accusation” policy.
12. **Accessibility and i18n.** Keyboard navigation, screen-reader labels,
    localization, right-to-left layouts.

## 8. Known limitations by design

- Curated fact-check corpus: two claims. “Not Sure” is common.
- No unrestricted web search or live news retrieval.
- Image/video classifiers are trained for specific data; they do not generalize
  to all generators or editing pipelines. Smaug is strong on current Google
  models but still missed 3/100 Nano Banana images (and 3/50 after stress
  recompression) in our evaluation.
- C2PA signatures are not verified.
- URL risk scoring is heuristic and can be gamed; absence of signals is not
  proof of safety.
- No audio analysis, no lip-sync detection, no temporal video model.
- CPU inference is fast enough for a demo but not for batch newsroom work.
- The extension is Chromium-only; Firefox MV3 sidebars differ and are untested.
